(File)\n\nMultimedia \xa0 Â· \xa0 User Galleries \xa0 Â· \xa0 News in Pictures\n\nSend us your pictures \xa0Â·\xa0 Send us your stories\n\nAxe murderer Henri van Breda has been sentenced to three life sentences for the murder of three of his family members, 15 years for the attempted murder of his sister, and one year for obstructing the course of justice.\n\nThe sentences will run concurrently.\n\nShortly after sentencing, Van Breda indicated he would appeal his conviction and sentences. A date was set down for June 27.\n\nJudge Siraj Desai said: ""These attacks display a high level of innate cruelty and an almost unprecedented disregard for the welfare of one\'s own family, one\'s parents and siblings. Each murderous attack upon a family member constitutes a very serious crime, warranting the severest penalty possible.\n\nAS IT HAPPENED: Henri van Breda handed 3 life sentences for triple axe murder of family\n\n""Viewing all these acts cumulatively, it must rank extremely high on the ladder of serious crime.""\n\nHe also said no argument had been advanced to mitigate the impact of the crime.\n\n""The violence was excessive and gratuitous.\n\n""We have no explanation from you.

Premeditated murder carries a prescribed sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nProsecutor Susan Galloway had argued that there were no substantial and compelling circumstances which would warrant deviating from the prescribed minimum sentence.\n\nVan Breda showed no remorse, Galloway had insisted, and Marli had survived because of a miracle, not because of mercy shown by her brother.\n\nThere was no prescribed sentence for attempted murder and the State argued that a sentence similar to the one for his parents\' and brother\'s murders be handed down for the attack on Marli as it was committed during the same incident with the same weapon and intent.\n\nDefence lawyer advocate Pieter Botha said his client had no previous convictions and had been young at the time of the brutal killings.\n\nVan Breda maintains his innocence.\n\nRead more on:\n\nhenri van breda\n\n|\n\ncape town\n\n|\n\ncourts\n\n|\n\ncrime\n\nX\n\nMan attempts to rape mother, allegedly abducts 2-year-old child\n\nJoin the conversation!\n\n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

"('Omotoso trial: This is what happens when a judge is recused', '","', 'Pastor Timothy Omotoso is standing trial for rape. (Eugene Coetzee, Gallo Images, The Herald, file)\n\nMultimedia \xa0 Â· \xa0 User Galleries \xa0 Â· \xa0 News in Pictures\n\nSend us your pictures \xa0Â·\xa0 Send us your stories\n\nThe rape case against Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso is far from over; in fact, it will soon have to start all over again.\n\nThis is because the recusal of Judge Mandela Makaula will have the matter against Omotoso and his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho – who are facing 63 charges and 34 alternative charges, which include rape, sexual assault and racketeering – restarted before a new judge, legal experts have told News24.\n\nPractically, this means a new judge and a completely new trial.\n\nAnd all evidence that has so far been heard by the court - including the stirring evidence given by Cheryl Zondi - will have to be presented afresh.\n\nThroughout the controversial trial, Omotoso\'s defence lawyer Peter Daubermann has attempted to have Makaula recuse himself.\n\nInitially, Daubermann pushed for the recusal of Makaula, accusing the judge of ""being biased"" following the testimony of Zondi, the first witness. He claimed he was ""too friendly"" with her.\n\nZondi testified that her life and those of about 30 others were those of sex slaves who would be called into Omotoso\'s bedroom, as and when he had interest in a particular woman, at a specific time.\n\nShe described Omotoso as a demanding, selfish predator who demanded that she perform ""horrible sexual acts"".\n\nThe 22-year-old has been hailed for her bravery and holding her own against what many supporters found to be an ""inhumane and unnecessary style of cross-examination"" by Daubermann.\n\nDuring cross-examination Daubermann at some point asked her just how deep she believed Omotoso had penetrated her and why she didn\'t scream.\n\nWhile Daubermann could not succeed in having Makaula recuse himself based on ""bias"" toward Zondi, he played his trump card when he confirmed to News24 last week that Makaula had agreed to recuse himself from the case and would provide reasons for the recusal on March 15.\n\nDaubermann said that he had a meeting with the State as well as Makaula in the judge\'s chambers on February 6, where he agreed to Daubermann\'s request to remove him from presiding over the trial.\n\n""The judge has further agreed that his decision to recuse himself may be published,"" Daubermann told News24.\n\nIn a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Eastern Cape, Daubermann alleged that the State informed Omotoso\'s defence team that, during the trial, certain state witnesses had\xa0stayed in a guesthouse owned by Makaula.\n\nWhen can a judge be recused?\n\nAccording to former magistrate and practising advocate Deon Pool, the Omotoso matter is not an everyday recusal.\n\n""This is quite unusual because a judge would normally not indicate [beforehand] that they were going to recuse themselves. Usually, a presiding officer recuses themselves when there is a perception of bias,"" Pool told News24.\n\n""In other words, it\'s got to do with the eye of the beholder. If I as a layperson in court get the impression, from the manner in which the case is being conducted, that the presiding officer [judge] is being biased, then that is the test,"" Pool said.\n\n""It is a very subjective test, but the purpose thereof is that, although it is a fine line to tread, it\'s still a judicial exercise. The presiding officer has to decide whether the perception that has been created by the proceedings can create the impression that there was bias against the accused or his/her defence,"" Pool emphasised.\n\nGiven the circumstances in the Omotoso case, considering the witnesses\' sleeping arrangements, Pool said it was ""perfectly within reason"" to demand a recusal. ""That would create a perception of bias.""\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nSo, once the judge is recused and a new judge takes over - does the trial just continue where it left off? Not so simple, says advocate James Grant.\n\n""If a judge revises him/herself, the trial must start afresh. All evidence must be led again,"" Grant told News24.\n\nPool agrees. ""The trial starts again from the beginning as if nothing has happened before.\n\n""But the record of the proceedings up to [the recusal] will be admissible in the coming proceedings.""\n\nIn other words, if a witness has already testified, and that witness deviates from their earlier testimony, they can be cross-examined based on the previous court record, Pool said.\n\nPhephelaphi Dube,\xa0director at the Centre for Constitutional Rights, told News24 it would make sense to start a new trial.\n\n""It would be difficult to separate which issues would have been impartial and which not - so it would be prudent to begin afresh,"" Dube said.\n\nThe Office of the Chief Justice told News24 that the case, which was initially postponed to April 16, will now be brought forward to March 15 by agreement between the State, the defence and the judge himself.\n\nA new judge will then have to be appointed before the trial can resume.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter')"

"('Lessons that we can learn from the Omotoso rape trialLessons that we can learn from the Omotoso rape trial', '","', ""One of the head-turning news stories of 2018 was the trial of controversial Nigerian pastor, Timothy Omotoso. Omotoso and his two co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, face several charges ranging from human trafficking to sexual assault and rape, allegedly committed between 2009 and 2017.\n\nWith the trial scheduled to resume early in February, the case is set to come into the spotlight again.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some insights.\n\n1. Not fighting back does not equal consent:\n\nJust after Omotoso’s trial commenced, news headlines were dominated by footage of complainant Cheryl Zondi who was cross-examined by the defence team to the point where new network eNCA turned footage of the interrogation for painful details into an advert with the headline “Is this justice?” Several reports took the stance that the questioning was handled as if Zondi were the accused and not the accuser.\n\nThe questioning of Zondi was seemingly abusive and offensive towards her moral integrity, placing the spotlight on the fact that, in South Africa, we still have a long way to go in terms of the definition of rape – especially where religious figures and figures of authority are concerned.\n\nThe definition of rape generally refers to the penetration of the vagina by the penis/foreign object against the will or consent of the victim, even if the victim does not physically resist. Many women are afraid to resisting because they feel intimidated and fear further physical injury. Zondi was only 14 at the time of the alleged rape and molestation – she had been groomed by the perpetrator and the fact that she did not try and stop him does in no way imply consent – she saw him as a Godly figure and out of fear and disbelief and paralysing shock she was incapable of making the “adult decision” to fight back.\n\n2. Religious figures are not exempt from the reason perpetrators commit acts of sexual violation.\n\nRape is a conscious decision – an act of power, control, anger, aggression, violence, conquest and degradation, aimed at women and expressed through the sexual act.\n\nAny man, even a religious figure, may rape to counter his feeling of inadequacy; to feel “high” on power and control and to release anger towards women due to not seeing women as worthy human beings.\n\nKeep in mind that a religious title is a title on paper. Being a man of God does not give you immunity, so we cannot automatically assume that a religious figure will behave morally simply because they have the title. Often, the cloak of religion hides the same insecurities that drive other perpetrators to commit violations.\n\nLearn to trust your instinct – if behaviour towards you feels wrong, uncomfortable and unwelcome, it is. Even if the acts are committed by a religious leader or another figure of authority.\n\n3. More women are speaking out about violations:\n\nWe had a case of a young girl (Grade 1) in Hout Bay whose stepfather was a pastor and had paid her to keep quiet about the alleged molestation. She attended one of our classes in which the children are told that if anything is happening to them at home, they are to not only tell their mothers but report it to their teachers as well.

The other applicants followed his instructions and turned to him for advice.\n\nAccording to information received‚ the house at 8 Nugget Road was utilised as a training facility.”\n\nChonco also confirmed that a number of individuals residing in the house were Tanzanian nationals. The state’s prosecution team has alleged that the accused were involved in an elaborate extortion plot, which targeted three businesses, demanding that the owners pay $100‚000 each via a Dubai account.\n\nThe state claims that the business owners were threatened with bombs and fire, should they default on the payments.\n\nDuring the raid on 8 Nugget Road, a kidnapped Tanzanian businessman was rescued.

The party’s mission statement was simple: the new South Africa should be founded on Christian principles, with religious leaders forming the frontrunners in national governance.\n\nDespite canvassing votes from devout Christians, the party came in 7th position overall at the 1994 ballot, only managing to scrape together 88,104 (0.45%) votes. Still, the party’s polling performance, although underwhelming, afforded the ACDP two seats in the National Assembly.\n\nFive years later, in 1999, the ACDP saw a massive upswell in support, particularly in the Western Cape. This renewed vigour earned the party 1.43% of the national vote and increased its seats in the National Assembly by four.\n\nThe general elections in 2004, saw a nominal increase in support for the ACDP, earning the party one more seat in parliament with 1.60% of the national voter share.\n\nThe 2009 elections signified a death spiral for the ACDP, with the party only securing 0.81% of the national vote. The decline continued in 2014, with the party securing only 0.57% of the national vote.\n\nThe ACDP has remained a minor opposition party since South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994. Since then, the party support at polling stations has hovered around the 1% mark.

"(""'He told me everything': Henri van Breda's girlfriend breaks silence"", '","', 'South Africa\n\nHenri van Breda’s girlfriend‚ Danielle Janse van Rensburg‚ has broken her silence on the conviction and sentencing of her boyfriend for the gruesome murders of his parents and brother‚ and attempted murder of his sister at their luxury Stellenbosch home in 2015.\n\nJanse van Rensburg was like a silent ghost at Van Breda’s trial – always there supporting him but not saying a word.\n\nShe got thinner and thinner as the case dragged on‚ and was often seen slipping into Castellos‚ the coffee shop opposite the High Court in Cape Town‚ wearing tiny jeans and a face of anguish.\n\nSince his conviction in May by Judge Siraj Desai‚ she has stayed mum‚ fuelling rumours that she was to be paid handsomely by an Australian television company for exclusive rights to a post-conviction interview.\n\nNow‚ in an episode of 60 Minutes flighted in Australia‚ Janse van Rensburg told the TV show’s interviewer Liz Hayes‚ that she was “very confident in the appeal”.\n\nAccording to 9News.com‚ the digital platform for the same outlet that flights the 60 Minutes show‚ Hayes interviewed Janse van Rensburg‚ and other key players‚ on South African soil.\n\nJanse van Rensburg told Hayes that her boyfriend was a victim‚ not a killer‚ and was “unable to hurt anything”‚ let alone kill his loved ones.\n\nShe also believed every word of the story he told in his plea statement and in court alike. She told Hayes: “He told me everything. He was very open. He was very honest. His story still always made sense to me‚ with the lack of evidence … we are very confident in the appeal.”\n\nWriting for 9News.com‚ reporter Liz Little said that it was clear from the interview with Hayes that “for all the flaws in Henri van Breda’s version of events and the staggering weight (of evidence) against him‚ his girlfriend Danielle justifies much of it with his recent diagnosis of epilepsy”.\n\nLittle said that the interview with Hayes showed that “the many inconsistencies in his (Van Breda’s) story” were explained away for Janse van Rensburg by the alleged seizure that he had suffered.\n\n“It’s not necessarily the reason‚ it just does put a lot of things together‚” Janse van Rensburg said in the interview. “Maybe things that I was previously a bit confused about absolutely made sense.”\n\nIt is not unusual for the partner of a murder accused to stand by the person in the dock‚ or to defend their innocence even when a court of law has decided otherwise. But in this case the couple only became an item after the crimes were committed.\n\nWhen Janse van Rensburg first met Van Breda‚ the two were enrolled for a cooking course at the Capsicum Chef School in Salt River. It was February 2016‚ a year after the bloody axe murders had transpired at the luxury estate.\n\nSomehow quarantined from the media frenzy surrounding the case‚ and the public hunger to discuss it at every water cooler‚ Janse van Rensburg claimed she knew nothing of the triple murders – let alone the rumours flying about that surviving son Van Breda’s days were numbered before police would come knocking at the door.\n\nIt must have come as a nasty shock‚ then‚ in June that year‚ when Van Breda was advised by his legal team to hand himself over for arrest.\n\nHe told me everything. He was very open. He was very honest.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority had‚ by then‚ a dossier thick with evidence to make the arrest. Out on bail worth R100‚000‚ Van Breda was arrested in September that year alongside Janse van Rensburg. The two were apprehended in Table View for being in possession of marijuana.\n\nHeld overnight‚ Van Breda was then released on a further R1‚000 bail‚ while his girlfriend was released on the same night as the arrest and let out on R200 bail.\n\nBut‚ when the two arrived in court for the case in April last year‚ Janse van Rensburg said the dagga was hers. The charges were withdrawn.\n\nThen‚ and now‚ she has stood by him – claiming his innocence and supporting him in court. This is against the backdrop of the overwhelming view that Van Breda had indeed wielded an axe and wiped out three family members.\n\nThe application for Van Breda’s leave to appeal will be heard on August 14.')"

I asked you several times to advance any reason in mitigation, I was asking you to give me a peg on which to hang my coat. You gave me no peg.""\n\n\'You could ignore the DNA altogether\'\n\nDesai said the sentence would have been different if the defence had shown him that the crimes committed were the result of a ""broken mind"", or of a disturbed individual.\n\nBotha said he could only work with the instructions he received, and his client maintained his innocence.\n\nProsecutor Susan Galloway said the court had correctly found there was premeditation.\n\nShe pointed out that, while the family was sleeping upstairs, Van Breda would have had to walk downstairs to the scullery to fetch the murder weapon, and then go upstairs.\n\nThere was also direct intent to kill because the axe was aimed at the head.\n\n""Even if that evidence is not enough for premeditation, the facts and circumstances are enough that this would always have been a matter where the most severe sentence was applicable.""\n\nShe accused Botha of nit-picking circumstantial evidence.\n\n""He is again taking apart the circumstantial evidence and then missing the wood for the trees.""\n\nShe said the court correctly found that not much weight needed to be afforded to the DNA.\n\n""You could ignore the DNA altogether and come to the same conclusion,"" commented Desai.\n\nHe postponed the matter until Monday for judgment.')"
"('Why did Henri van Breda do it? – The Citizen', '","', 'Henri van Breda has left Kelly Phelps baffled. The University of Cape Town senior lecturer in the department of public law has been following the trial of the axe murderer with interest. But what remains a mystery to her has been the inability of the state and defence to prove Van Breda’s motive.\n\nWhy did he try to wipe out his entire family and attempt to kill his sister, Marli, on that fateful Wednesday of January 27, 2015 – the day Martin van Breda, wife Teresa and son Rudi were found axed to death?\n\nYesterday, Judge Siraj Desai sentenced Van Breda to three life terms, 15 years’ imprisonment for attempted murder and 12 months’ imprisonment for obstructing the course of justice. The sentences will run concurrently.\n\nHe was also declared unfit to possess a firearm.\n\n“Throughout the trial, Henri has maintained his innocence and the judge has emphasised that there has been no evidence of motive – something which has left me numb,” said Phelps.\n\nWith suggested motives having ranged from money to drugs “these have merely remained rumours and speculation”.\n\nPhelps said it was highly unlikely that “if you plan the demise of your family for financial gain, you use an axe to kill them”.\n\n“It is unlikely that you can plan killing them in such a brutal and grotesque manner and put yourself at the centre of the murder,” said Phelps, who has followed several South African family killings in the past.\n\n“It has been very hard to read Henri’s demeanour in this trial as there were times he was sedated, sometimes nervous and uneasy.\n\n“Failure to establish the motive has proven to be the weakest case for the state. We should remember no one else was present at the time except Henri. Perhaps his sister, Marli, will speak one day.”\n\nPhelps found it “hard to understand how a young man in his 20s, brought up so well in such a nuclear family” could “commit such a heinous act”.\n\n“There has been no evidence of psychopathy or antisocial behaviour,” said Phelps. “No person can find it so easy to sleep at night after axing to death your maternal parents and brother. This has been one of the most brutal cases I have seen – the killing of your most intimate family in this fashion.”\n\nFor Gauteng clinical psychologist Lynette le Roux, who specialises in psycho-legal and forensic work, the murder trial posed more questions than answers.\n\nLe Roux said: “There are very tough questions to be asked and there is not one answer because this is an extreme case. First, it would be important to establish the history with his parents, brother and sister.\n\n“Also establishing a history of aggressiveness towards other people would be vital.\n\n“Has he had difficulty in relationships with other people? Is there history of coming into conflict with the law? Was there substance or alcohol abuse?\n\n“Understanding past history from childhood would also be important. Did he ever abuse animals? Is there a personality dynamic that made him behave in this manner? Using an axe to kill is very violent and it begs the question: what made him so angry?”\n\nThe Van Breda murder case has served as a chilling reminder of the growing level of family violence in South Africa.

""He came up to the top of the queue and set off the blast,"" he said.\n\nThe series of attacks started with the bombing of St Anthony\'s Shrine\xa0in the capital. Five other blasts followed within half an hour, including the bombings on St Sebastian\'s Church in Negombo, about 30km from the capital, and another in Batticaloa, 250km east of the capital.\n\nPolice spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said the wounded were being evacuated while security forces cordoned off the areas and search operations were under way.\n\nPhotos circulating on social media showed the roof of one church had been blown almost entirely off in the blast.\n\nThe floor was littered with a mixture of roof tiles, splintered wood and blood.\n\nSeveral people could be seen covered in blood, some trying to help those with more serious wounds.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government declared a nationwide curfew with immediate effect,\xa0Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said.\n\nGovernment officials also said major social media networks and messaging apps, including Facebook and WhatsApp, were blocked inside the country to prevent misinformation and rumours.\n\n""This is only a temporary measure,"" Udaya R Seneviratne, secretary to the president, said in a statement.\n\nAl Jazeera\'s Minelle Fernandez, reporting from Colombo, said the crisis appeared to be over by Sunday night.\n\n""We\'re hearing that Colombo national hospital is still receiving casualties brought in from the multiple locations.\n\n""In terms of law enforcement, we\'ve been hearing that all festivities have been cancelled, that security in and around the city has been tightened,"" Fernandez said.\n\n""It\'s still very open-ended … it\'s too early [to speculate who is responsible] but security in the capital and the airport has been stepped up following the attacks.""\n\nRajiva Wijesinha, a former member of the Sri Lankan parliament, told Al Jazeera the coordinated nature of the attacks shocked the country.\n\n""It\'s actually extremely chilling. We\'ve never had anything of this sort before. Sri Lanka had a terrible time under Tamil Tiger terrorism for about 25 years and then there was a great sense of relief, which I am afraid the West has been fighting with us about, when we got rid of the Tiger terrorists,"" Rajiva said.\n\n""But the Tiger terrorists were never as well organised and never quite as brilliant in synchronisation and this is obviously something on a much larger scale, which is frankly quite terrifying,"" he said.\n\n""The range of these attacks and the concentration on the Christian churches and then the hotels as well suggest we are dealing with something really quite horrible.""\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera from Colombo, Ashwin Hemmathagama, a reporter with the Daily FT, said the attacks were a blow to the country\'s tourism sector.\n\n""At the moment police have cordoned off the areas and cautioned the public to remain vigilant. They have asked the public to stay indoors and avoid hasty decisions because investigations are under way,""\xa0Hemmathagama said.\n\n""After the civil war ended, almost a decade ago, the tourism industry was picking up. Basically, everything was back to its current perspective, but unfortunately this kind of attack will definitely cripple the tourism sector.""\n\nAdditional reporting by\xa0Dilrukshi Handunnetti from Colombo')"
